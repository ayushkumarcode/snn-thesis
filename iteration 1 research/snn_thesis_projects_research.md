# SNN Thesis & Student Projects on GitHub

looked through github on 2026-02-24 to find undergraduate and masters thesis/dissertation projects related to SNNs, neuromorphic computing, etc. found 40+ student and research projects.

the overall pattern for undergrad projects is pretty clear: most BSc/3rd-year projects focus on a single well-defined task (usually MNIST or gesture classification), use one established framework (snnTorch, Brian2, SpikingJelly, or BindsNET), compare SNN performance against a conventional ANN baseline, and work with 1-2 datasets. masters-level stuff tends to be more ambitious -- hardware deployment (SpiNNaker, Loihi, FPGA), multi-domain applications (robotics, RL), or novel architectures. worth noting that few projects include actual thesis PDFs in the repo, though several reference external documents.

## confirmed undergraduate / BSc / final year projects

these are repos explicitly identified as undergraduate or final-year projects.

### 1.1 Shape Detector SNN (University of Manchester)
- **URL**: https://github.com/filippoferrari/shape_detector_snn
- **Dissertation repo**: https://github.com/filippoferrari/bsc_dissertation
- **Description**: Shape detection using spiking neural networks, BSc AI dissertation supervised by Prof. Steve Furber (creator of SpiNNaker)
- **Framework**: Python, pyDVS library
- **Dataset**: Custom shape images processed through DVS simulation
- **Results**: Not quantified in README
- **Thesis PDF**: LaTeX source in dissertation repo (may need compilation)
- **Complexity**: MODERATE - well-structured with tests, CI, configs
- **Stars**: 2 | **Last updated**: Archived 2024 | **Commits**: 107
- good example of a BSc project at a top university. clean code structure, proper testing, supervised by a world expert. feels like a solid reference for what a strong undergrad project looks like.

### 1.2 Musical Pattern Recognition in SNNs (BEng Final Year)
- **URL**: https://github.com/mrahtz/musical-pattern-recognition-in-spiking-neural-networks
- **Description**: Spiking neural network that differentiates musical notes from audio sequences
- **Framework**: Brian 2 (neural simulator), Brian 1 Hears bridge, NumPy, matplotlib, Mingus music library
- **Dataset**: Custom monophonic audio sequences (.wav)
- **Results**: Successfully differentiated notes; visualizations of spike patterns, membrane potentials, synaptic weight evolution
- **Thesis PDF**: YES - available at http://amid.fish/beng_project_report.pdf
- **Complexity**: MODERATE - integrates neuromorphic simulation, audio processing, STDP
- **Stars**: 49 | **Forks**: 17 | **Last updated**: Archived
- this one's really good. novel application domain (music), strong documentation, thesis PDF available. the high star count shows people are interested. good model for an ambitious but achievable BEng project.

### 1.3 Spiking Neural Network for Digit Recognition (King's College London BSc)
- **URL**: https://github.com/LucaMozzo/SpikingNeuralNetwork
- **Description**: Efficient C++ implementation of a stochastic SNN for handwritten digit recognition
- **Framework**: C/C++ (custom implementation), OpenCV3, SQLite, Visual Studio 2017
- **Dataset**: MNIST
- **Results**: Multiple decoding methods explored (rate decoding, first-to-spike). Original implementation required 2h37m per epoch, heavily optimized.
- **Thesis PDF**: Not in repo but referenced as 2018 BSc thesis
- **Complexity**: HIGH for an undergrad - built from scratch in C++, no framework used
- **Stars**: 11 | **Forks**: 3 | **Commits**: 45
- pretty impressive that they built everything from scratch in C++. most students use existing frameworks. the optimization challenge (2h37m -> much faster) shows real engineering effort.

### 1.4 SNN for Autonomous Locomotion Control (Bachelor Thesis)
- **URL**: https://github.com/romenr/bachelorthesis
- **Description**: Using SNNs to control autonomous locomotion of a mobile robot following a red object
- **Framework**: V-REP (robot simulation), ROS, Python, R-STDP learning
- **Dataset**: N/A (simulation-based)
- **Results**: INCOMPLETE - "network weights do not seem to converge"
- **Thesis PDF**: TeX source in repo (thesis folder), presentation slides included
- **Complexity**: MODERATE-HIGH - robotics simulation + SNN + RL
- **Stars**: 2 | **Forks**: 1 | **Commits**: 191
- honest about failing to converge, which is actually quite realistic for a bachelor thesis. the project was ambitious (robotics + SNN + learning), and partial results are normal for this scope. good reminder that not all thesis projects succeed fully.
