# spiking neural networks for NLP / text tasks

i looked into whether SNNs can do NLP stuff -- SpikingBERT, SpikeGPT, SpikeLLM, text encoding as spikes, sentiment analysis. this is a genuinely novel and rapidly emerging direction that's only really been viable since 2023. there are some landmark papers (SpikingBERT at AAAI 2024, SpikeGPT from UCSC, SpikeLM at ICML 2024, SpikeLLM at ICLR 2025), but performance still lags behind conventional models by 3-15% on standard benchmarks. the main argument is energy efficiency (10-60x reduction), not accuracy.

for an undergrad thesis: exceptionally high novelty but significant technical risk. the most feasible approach would be a focused binary sentiment classification task using ANN-to-SNN conversion with pre-trained word embeddings encoded as Poisson spike trains. open-source code exists but needs adaptation. a realistic project would compare SNN vs ANN on 2-3 text datasets and quantify the accuracy-energy tradeoff.

high risk, high reward. very few undergrads have tried this worldwide. it'd be a standout thesis if scoped right, but needs careful management to avoid scope creep.

## the key models -- what are they and do they work?

### SpikeGPT (UC Santa Cruz, Feb 2023)

first generative pre-trained language model built with SNNs. uses an RWKV-inspired architecture (not standard transformer). replaces self-attention with linear-complexity spiking mechanism. 45M and 216M parameter variants.

does it work? partially:

| Benchmark | SpikeGPT 216M | BERT |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| SST-2 (sentiment) | 88.76% | 91.73% |
| SST-5 (5-class) | 51.27% | 53.21% |
| MR (movie reviews) | 85.63% | 86.72% |
| Subj (subjectivity) | 95.30% | N/A |
| WikiText-2 (perplexity) | 18.01 PPL | -- |

claims 32.2x fewer operations on neuromorphic hardware. works competitively on simple classification (within 1-3% of BERT). generation is weaker. the 216M pretrained model is needed -- 45M underperforms badly.
